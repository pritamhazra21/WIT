## Internet Telephony (1L):

Internet Telephony Protocol is also called Voice Over IP . It is a real-time interactive audio/video application. As from the name Internet Telephony, it uses internet as a telephone network with additional features. To communicate between two parties, it uses packet-switched Internet.

There are two different types of protocols that enable Internet Telephony.

1. H.323
2. Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)

### H.323 :
Basically, H.323 may be a standard set by ITU which allows telephones on the general public telephone network to speak to computers connected to internet. The architecture of H.323 is shown as shown as:

H.323 Architecture Model

At the center, there is gateway placed which connects the internet to the telephone network. Gateway translates a message from one protocol to another. It speaks H.323 protocol on Internet site and PSTN i.e. Public Switched Telephone Network protocol on telephone side. It will act as both computer and telephone. A LAN may have a gatekeeper which controls the terminals under its jurisdiction calledzone.

### Protocols of H.323 :
To maintain audio or video communication, H.323 uses a number of protocols. The various protocols used are as shown in the following figure.

H.323 Protocol Stack

1. G.711 or G.723.1 –
These protocols are used for compression.
2. H.245 –
In this, multiple compression protocols are permitted, H.245 allows the terminals to negotiate which protocol to use for compression. H.245 also negotiates bit rate.
3. RTCP –
It is used to control RTP channels.
4. Q.931 –
This protocol is required for establishing and releasing connections, providing dial tones, making ringing sounds.
5. H.225 –
This protocol enables the terminals to talk to gatekeepers. This protocol also manages PC-to-gatekeeper channel called RAS channel. This channel allows the terminals to join and leave the zone, request and return bandwidth and provide status updates.
6. RTP –
It is used for actual data transmission.

## VoIP.

Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP), is a technology that allowing you to make voice calls over a broadband Internet connection instead of an analog (regular) phone line. Some VoIP services allow you to call people using the same service, but others may allow you to call anyone. They can have a telephone number – including local, long-distance, mobile, and international numbers or not. Some VoIP services only work over your computer or a special VoIP phone while other services allow you to use a traditional phone connected to a VoIP adapter. 

How VoIP / Internet Voice Works – 

Voice is converted into a digital signal by VoIP services that travel over the Internet. If the regular phone number is called, the signal is converted to a regular telephone signal i.e. an analog signal before it reaches the destination. VoIP can allow you to make a call directly from a computer having a special VoIP phone, or a traditional phone connected to a special adapter. Wireless hot spots in locations such as airports, hospitals, cafes, etc allow you to connect to the Internet and can enable you to use VoIP service wirelessly. 

Equipments Required – 

A high-speed Internet connection is required which can be through a cable modem or high-speed services such as a local area network. A computer, adaptor, or specialized phone is required. Some VoIP services only work over your computer or a special VoIP phone. Other services allow you to use a traditional phone connected to a VoIP adapter. If you use your computer some software and an inexpensive microphone are needed. VoIP phones plug directly into your broadband connection and operate largely like a traditional telephone. If you use a telephone with a VoIP adapter, you can dial just as you always have, and the service provider may also provide a dial tone. 

Advantages of VoIP – 
 

1. Some VoIP services offer features and services that are not available with a traditional phone, or are available but only for an additional fee. 
1. Paying for both a broadband connection and a traditional telephone line can be avoided. 
1. Smoother connection than an analog signal can be provided. 
 
Disadvantages of VoIP – 
 

1. Some VoIP services don’t work during power outages and the service provider may not offer backup power. 
1. Not all VoIP services connect directly to emergency services through emergency service numbers. 
1. VoIP providers may or may not offer directory assistance.
