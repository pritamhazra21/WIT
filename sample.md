HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is the standard markup language used for creating web pages and applications. HTML uses a set of tags and attributes to structure the content and define the layout and formatting of a web page.

Here's a basic example of an HTML document structure:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>My Web Page</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Welcome to My Web Page</h1>
  <p>This is a paragraph of text.</p>
  <img src="image.jpg" alt="My Image">
</body>
</html>
```

Let's break down the structure:

- `<!DOCTYPE html>`: This declaration at the beginning tells the browser that the document is an HTML5 document.
- `<html>`: The `<html>` element is the root element of an HTML page.
- `<head>`: The `<head>` element contains meta-information about the document, such as the page title and links to stylesheets or scripts.
- `<title>`: The `<title>` element sets the title of the web page, which is displayed in the browser's title bar or tab.
- `<body>`: The `<body>` element contains the visible content of the web page, such as headings, paragraphs, images, and other elements.
- `<h1>`: The `<h1>` element represents a heading level 1, which is the largest and most important heading.
- `<p>`: The `<p>` element represents a paragraph of text.
- `<img>`: The `<img>` element is used to display an image on the web page. The `src` attribute specifies the path or URL of the image, and the `alt` attribute provides alternative text for the image, which is displayed if the image cannot be loaded.

This is just a simple example, and HTML offers many more tags and attributes for structuring and styling web content.
