# Introduction

## Internet
Internet is a global network that connects billions of computers across the world with each other and to the World Wide Web. It uses standard internet protocol suite (TCP/IP) to connect billions of computer users worldwide. It is set up by using cables such as optical fibers and other wireless and networking technologies. At present, internet is the fastest mean of sending or exchanging information and data between computers across the world.

## World Wide Web (1L):
## Domain and Sub domain 

In the context of computer networks and the internet, a domain refers to a group of devices or resources that are organized and managed together. It represents a specific network or a collection of related resources.

A subdomain, on the other hand, is a subset or subdivision of a larger domain. It allows for further organization and categorization of resources within the main domain. Subdomains are typically used to distinguish different sections or departments within an organization or to allocate specific functions or services to different parts of a website or network.

For example, in the domain "example.com," a subdomain could be "blog.example.com" or "shop.example.com." These subdomains can be used to separate the blog section or the e-commerce section of the website from the main domain.

In summary, a domain represents a broader group or network of resources, while a subdomain is a subset or subdivision within that domain, used for further organization or categorization purposes.

## Address Resolution,
Address resolution refers to the process of mapping a higher-level identifier, such as a logical or symbolic address, to a lower-level identifier, such as a physical address. It is commonly used in computer networks, specifically in the context of mapping IP addresses to MAC addresses in Ethernet networks.

In an IP network, devices are identified by their IP addresses, which are logical addresses assigned to them. However, when data needs to be transmitted over the network, it needs to be delivered to the correct device's physical address, known as the MAC address. This is where address resolution comes into play.

The Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is a commonly used protocol for address resolution in Ethernet networks. When a device wants to send data to another device on the same network, it broadcasts an ARP request packet, asking for the MAC address associated with a specific IP address. The device that has the requested IP address responds with its MAC address, allowing the sender to create an entry in its ARP cache and use the MAC address for future communications.

In short, address resolution is the process of mapping higher-level identifiers, such as IP addresses, to lower-level identifiers, such as MAC addresses, in order to facilitate communication within a network.

## DNS

An application layer protocol defines how the application processes running on different systems, pass the messages to each other.

+ DNS stands for Domain Name System.
+ DNS is a directory service that provides a mapping between the name of a host on the network and its numerical address.
+ DNS is required for the functioning of the internet.
+ Each node in a tree has a domain name, and a full domain name is a sequence of symbols specified by dots.
+ DNS is a service that translates the domain name into IP addresses. This allows the users of networks to utilize user-friendly names when looking for other hosts instead of remembering the IP addresses.
+ For example, suppose the FTP site at EduSoft had an IP address of 132.147.165.50, most people would reach this site by specifying ftp.EduSoft.com. Therefore, the domain name is more reliable than IP address.
